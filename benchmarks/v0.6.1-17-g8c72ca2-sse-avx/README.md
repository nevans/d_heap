# Benchmarks after converting to use SSE/AVX/AVX512 v0.6.1-21-g7bc7ca8

This was an experiment to see if searching for the min index via `<immintrin.h>`
vector extensions would be faster than a simple `for` loop (after compiler
optimizations and CPU pipelines' branch prediction).  The results were mixed: It
is a speedup for larger `d` values especially on larger heaps.  Unfortunately
it was a significant slowdown for the ideal `d` values on "normal" sized heaps.
And in any case, it was an enormous jump in code complexity for speedups that
were only apparent on very _very_ large heaps (e.g. ~10 million entries).

One of the issues may be that, at the volumes were talking about, there are big
slowdowns just to add a single new `if` statement to the `sift-down` operation,
and a generic `d`-ary heap that allows any value for `d` needs to add multiple
new branches just to deal with large range of possible child counts.  With
macros or code generation, we could create a special `sift-down` for every
useful `d` value and use a branch-free "happy path" when `d` children are
present.  But that's another hypothesis to experiment with on another day.
